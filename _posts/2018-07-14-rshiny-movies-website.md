In this project, we build a shiny app to display insteresting movie infomation based on data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).  It supports movies recommendation and people search.

You could get the infomation from the latest movies and popular movies. Also you could ask for movie recommendations based on the genre you prefer. In addition, you could search for your favorite actors or directors to get their movies and personal information.
